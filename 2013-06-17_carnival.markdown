me: I'm going to sell you guys to the carnival!
Simon: What will they do with us in the carnival?
me: I don't know, probably feed you to the bears.
Simon: I hope not, I want to run the games.
me: Oh. You want to be a carnie?
Simon: What's a carnie?
me: It's the person that runs the games.
Simon: Yeah, I want to be a carnie. No, I want to be the owner. How does somebody become the owner?
me: I don't know. They probably just buy a carnival?
Simon: Buy a carnival? But they won't even fit in a store!
