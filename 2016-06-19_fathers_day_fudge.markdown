Taking a piece of peanut butter fudge out of a Tupperware container in front of Simon...

Simon: wait, what is that!?

Me: it's part of my Father's Day present, from Becky.

Simon: I want some!

Me: you can't have any, you're not a father.

Simon: well, good fathers always share things with their kids.
