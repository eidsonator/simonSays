Who am I???

i enjoy long, moonlit walks on the beach... oops, wrong site.

I am a father, web developer, and in my free time (what is this 'free time' I speak of, you say?) a music aficionado.

I have two (usually) wonderful kids, Marley and Simon, who keep me out of trouble. 
Marley is a smart and sassy teenage girl, with all of the joys that those years can bring.
Simon is a unique young man and our conversations have become semi-Facebook famous; 
all of my friends kept suggesting that I write a book featuring our exchanges,
but I thought a blog might be a better place for them. So I present to you 'Simon Says'.

I have been employed for the last three years at a manfacturing company writing mostly in-house, web-based CRUD interfaces to interact with dozens of databases. For the most part, I am writing web 2.0 applications in PHP/CoffeeScript/HTML/CSS, using Symfony2, Angular, jQuery and Semantic-ui, although I do have a lot of older projects written using Backbone and Bootstrap. I have one small project using Python, a lot of small utility scripts written in Ruby, as well as a year and a half experience supporting legacy C++ code. I am constantly learning new frameworks (currently Laravel, lets see how good I am at keeping this updated) and trying to improve my code on my personal time. The scariest thing for me is looking at code I wrote six months ago!

I am a music junkie who enjoys accumulating vinyl records, collecting vintage (pre-1980) stereo equiptment, and enjoying live music performances (although, not as many now as I once did). My record collection consists of approximately 80% jazz music, but my taste in music is wildly eclectic. You might catch me listening to bluegrass, 80's hip-hop, classical, and jazz standards back-to-back on any given day. I did spend a short time in my life as a studio and live sound engineer, but that lifestyle didn't fit the best with the aspirations of a family man.
