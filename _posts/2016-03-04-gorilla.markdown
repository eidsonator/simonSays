Me: Come on, Simon, Let's go to the store and buy a grill.

Simon: Good, now I'll have someone to play with, when you are busy!

Me: What? I said let's go buy a GRILL, not a GIRL.

Simon: No, buy a boy gorilla, not a girl gorilla.

Me: Simon, we are buying a GRILL not a GORILLA.

Simon: No, we should buy a gorilla, so I'll have something to do while you are doing homework.

Me: I don't think they sell gorillas at Wal-Mart.

Simon: What kind of stores do they sell gorillas at? And how big are gorillas?
