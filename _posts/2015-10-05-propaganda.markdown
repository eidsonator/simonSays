After Simon read a story about "The Flower Sale" for his homework. One of the discussion questions was, 
"why did some of the students hang up posters around the school?"

I'm expecting to maybe hear the word advertisement in the answer, but Simon being Simon has to take it up one notch.

"Well, it was to tell the other kids about the flower sale. Basically, it was propaganda."
