*Cleaning up our dishes from making cheesecakes for a Halloween party tonight....*

**Marley**: Do you want a spoonful of cheesecake filling, dad?

**Me**: No, I don't like cheesecake.

**Marley**: Then why did we just make two of them?

**Me**: Because that's what your brother requested for the party. Don't you realize that almost everything I do, I do for you guys? Because I'm trying to be a halfway decent dad.

**Simon**: You're not a halfway decent dad. You're a decent dad.
