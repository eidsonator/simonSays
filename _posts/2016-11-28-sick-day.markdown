*Simon woke me up about 4:30 this morning to let me know that he had vomited.  I cleaned him up and changed his bedding, and tucked him back in.  He woke up about 10:30...*

**Simon**: Why aren't I in school I thought it was Monday?

**Me**: Well, you puked this morning.

**Simon**:  I thought it had something to do with that.

*I checked his temperature, with our new thermometer that turns green, yellow, or red, in addition to displaying the temperature...*

**Me**:  It's yellow.

**Simon**:  What does "yellow" insinuate in the pattern of red, yellow, green?

**Me**:  It means you have a mild temperature.

**Simon**:  Yay!  I get another sick day!

**Me**:  I've never met anybody so happy to be sick before.  Do you want to lay down on the couch and watch some TV?

**Simon**: No, my belly hurts to bad to sit around and be lazy.
