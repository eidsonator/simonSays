**Simon**: Can I borrow that green and black striped blanket of yours, I want to take a nap?

**Me**: A NAP?  You just woke up!

**Simon**:  I don't mean a closed-eye nap, I want to take a open-eyed nap on the couch and watch tv.

**Me**:  Oh, you just want to be lazy?

**Simon**:  Yeah, I just want to be lazy.
