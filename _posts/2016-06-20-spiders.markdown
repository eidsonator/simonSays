Simon:  There are more spiders in this house now there is one in the video game room!

Me: ...

Simon: Well, I'm not sure if it was a spider or a bug because I was too scare to stand there and count the legs.

Me: You mean an insect?

Simon: Yes, an insect.  But there are some insects that can kill you too.

Me:  You are not going to die from an insect bite in central Ohio.  Maybe in the jungles of South America you might.

Simon:  How about the jungles of Brazil?

Me:  Brazil is in South America.

Simon:  How come they call it South America if they don't speak Amer... I mean if they don't speak English there?

Me:  Why do they call us America, because we do speak English?  Where did English come from?

Simon: England.

Me:  So why don't they just call us England Junior?

Simon:  Because that would be a stupid a name for a country.

Me:  How about West England?

Simon:  I think there is a West England already.

Me:  Hmmmm...  Maybe West London.

Simon:  So anyway, would you come get this spider out of the video game room?
