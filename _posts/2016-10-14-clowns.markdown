*At the breakfast table this morning*

**Simon**: So, umm, dad, have you heard about this creepy killer clown thing?

**Me**: Yeah.

**Simon**:  It seems like some of them are pranksters.

**Me**: ALL of them are pranksters.

**Simon**: No, some of them are real.  And it is giving professional clowns a bad reputation.

**Me**: You never did care for professional clowns, did you?

**Simon**:  I knew this day was going to come!
