**Me**: Go find your real dad!

**Simon**: You are my real dad!

**Me**: GO HOME!

**Simon**: This is my home.

**Me**: Go to the Moon!

**Simon**: No. The moon is not my home.

**Me**: It might be, you might be an alien. Have you ever considered that? How do you know you're not an alien?

**Simon**: Because I am annoying, and aliens are not annoying. Plus aliens aren't named Simon.
