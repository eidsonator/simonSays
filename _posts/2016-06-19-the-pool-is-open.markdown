**Me**: so tonight, we're going to Kelsey's graduation party at grandma and grandpa's...

**Simon**: no

**Me**: and go swimming in their pool, and eat tacos, and cake...

**Simon**: wait! How do you know the pool is going to be open.

**Me**: because they told me it is.

**Simon**: well, obviously they are lying to get me to come.
