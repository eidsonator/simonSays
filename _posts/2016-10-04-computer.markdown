*Getting Simon ready for his shower Sunday so we could go out for breakfast with my parents.  Marley was listening to some "music" in her room...*

**Me**: Could you please turn that down, I'm getting brain cancer as we speak.

**Simon**:  There is no such thing as brain cancer.

**Me**: Yes, there is.

**Simon**: No, you can only get cancer in body parts.

**Me**: The brain **is** a body part.

**Simon**: Just trust me on this.

**Me**: No, you should trust me.  I've proven myself to be a pretty trustworthy guy.

**Simon**: How about **you** trust **me** when it comes to *ACTUAL* science, and *I'll* trust *you* when it comes to *COMPUTER* science.
