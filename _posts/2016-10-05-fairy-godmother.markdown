*Simon's journal entry he brought home from schoool today.  Fairy Godmothers was the topic:*

If I had a fairy godmother, I would ask her for samurai swords and armour. They will look like gold. My armour will 
look like cheetahs. it is made of gold.

my second wish is to be rich. I want $50,000,000. I will but the universe.

My third wish is to be the leader of the world.  i will nuke north korea. i will make the x men.

I am being proactive by making superheroes.

Simon
