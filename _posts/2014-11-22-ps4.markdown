**Simon**: I just want Santa to bring me a PS4.

**Me**: Why?

**Simon**: Cause its gotta bunch of really cool games for it.

**Me**: A bunch of really cool games that are really expensive.

**Simon**: Not all of them are expensive. Like the Amazing Spiderman 2.

**Me**: How much does it cost?

**Simon**: Ummmmmmm....... twenty bucks.

**Me**: I think you're just making up numbers.

**Simon**: Nope, twenty is a real number.
