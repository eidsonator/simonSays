**Simon**: any idea when you'll have enough money to buy me that game that I rented last weekend?

**Me**: Christmas is getting close. I told you Santa will probably bring it to you.

**Simon**: yeah, but I haven't been good enough this year for him to bring me anything, I'll probably just get a big pile of coal. So you might as well just go ahead and buy it now.
