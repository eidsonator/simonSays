**Simon**: why do some shirts have little pouches right over top where your man boob area is?

**Me**: I dunno, maybe you should ask grandpa.

**Simon**: grandpa, why do some shirts have a pouch over top your man boobs?

**Grandpa**: oh, it's just to keep like pens or pencils in and stuff.

**Me**: hey Simon, you wanna know another name for those little "pouches"? They're called "pockets".

**Simon**: nope, pockets are only in pants.
