*Simon asked for some help with a video game so I helped for a couple of seconds to get him past the part he was stuck on.*

*Just a few minutes later he asked for help again, while knowing that I was trying to get some housework done.*

**Simon**: And I can twenty percent guarantee this will be the last time.

**Me**: ha-ha! Oh really?

**Simon**: yes, I can't hundred percent guarantee it.

*(It wasn't)*
