*Simon knocked a roll of paper towels off the table, and they unrolled across the length of the living room.
I was rolling them back up, and comically pretending to be frustrated...*

**Simon**:  What? It was an accident.

**Me**: I know.

**Simon**: It was.

**Me**: Life is an accident.

**Simon**: I thought having kids was an accident?
