*While cooking breakfast for Simon...*

**Simon**: how old will you be when I'm 61?

**Me**: I'll be 92. Wow I'm old. Will you cook me breakfast when you're 61?

**Simon**: well, not every day.

**Me**: who's going to take care of me when I'm old and feeble?

**Simon**: Marley will probably put you in one of those nursery-homes.
