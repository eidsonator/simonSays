*Simon was sent home from school today with a fever, and my mom told me to check him for a rash or mouth sores, 
because foot-mouth disease, or something, is going around. So I called him downstairs to check for sores, after I looked
in his mouth, and decided he was sore-free, he proceeds to tell me:*

**Simon**:  You know there is an unwritten rule in the military...

**Me**: There is?

**Simon**: Yes.  Never stab anybody in the butt, it is just disrespectful.
