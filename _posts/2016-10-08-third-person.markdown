*Waiting to place an order at the drive through window...*

**Me**: Do you want your usual?

**Simon**:Yes.

**Me**: I'm not sure what daddy is going to get...

**Simon**: Why are you speaking in the third person?

**Me**: That is just what the dad does sometimes.

**Simon**:  Would you please stop?

**Me**: You don't like when the dad does this?

**Simon**: Ugh!
