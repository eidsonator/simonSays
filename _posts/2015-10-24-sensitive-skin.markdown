*Simon trying to talk his way out of getting his fingernails trimmed.*

**Simon**: Now that they're clean, I think that takes away some of the need to trim them.

**Me**: ha-ha ha-ha, I don't think so.

**Simon**: Well, I think the only reason it hurt you when I touched your skin with them is because of your old skin.

**Me**: No, you scratched the crap out of me. It's nothing to do with old skin.

**Simon**: I'm serious, you're middle aged. That's the same thing as old. And old people's skin is more sensitive.

**Me**: No, I'm young and pretty around you're old and ugly.

**Simon**: No, you're old and... Well.... Not ugly.
