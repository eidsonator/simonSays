*I use reverse psychology jokingly on Simon in the mornings when he's grumpy and tell him, "you better not smile!"
This always works wonders and he grins ear to ear, saying, "I'm smiling. I'm smiling."*

This morning I told him, "I'll give you a dollar if you stop smiling."

"No. For one, I can't buy any video games with a dollar."

"And for two?" I asked.

"Well, I only had the one!" He answers.
