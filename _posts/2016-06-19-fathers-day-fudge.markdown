*Taking a piece of peanut butter fudge out of a Tupperware container in front of Simon...*

**Simon:** wait, what is that!?

**Me:** it's part of my Father's Day present, from Becky.

**Simon:** I want some!

**Me:** you can't have any, you're not a father.

**Simon:** well, good fathers always share things with their kids.
