*We're trying out the new local diner for the first time. We had to grab one of the high tables with the high bar seats, because every other seat was taken. Simon's worried about getting out of the chair when dinner is over....*

**Simon**: So, AGAIN, how am I going to get down from this chair?

**Me**: we'll call the fire department.

**Simon**: I'm not a cat stuck in a tree.
