*Hearing a wrapper crinkling in the kitchen, not an hour after dinner...*

Me: Simon, what are you doing?

Simon: Getting a Rice Krispie Treat.

Me: How are you hungry we just finished dinner.  You eat too much junk food.

Simon:  Rice Krispie Treats are not junk food.

Me: Yes they are.

Simon:  How dare you mock the ultimate amazing tastiness that is the Rice Krispie Treat kingdom?
