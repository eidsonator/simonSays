    <p>If you’ve met Simon, you know that he enjoys disagreeing just to disagree (I think he got that from his sister).  So he shocked me when having this conversation about whether or not I was eating grapes at Kroger’s before making it to the checkout.</p>

<p>Me:  I did not eat grapes out of the bag before paying for them.  That is illegal.</p>

<p>Simon:  No it is not.  You might get in trouble with the store, but it is not illegal.</p>

<p>Me:  It is illegal!  It is stealing!</p>

<p>Simon:  I’m not going to argue about something so useless.</p>

<p>Me:  Hahahaha!  You?  Really?</p>

<p>Simon: yes.</p>
