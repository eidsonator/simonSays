    <p>Simon had a less than stellar school-year, due to some behavioral issues, and the months of November and December were especially rough on him (and worse on his teachers, who bent over backwards to help him be successful).</p>

<p>So, one day after school in December, my mom asks him, “Simon, how was your day at school today?”</p>

<p>His reply? “Well… that depends… do you want my opinion, or the teachers opinion?”</p>
