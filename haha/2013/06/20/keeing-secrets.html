<h1>Simon Says</h1>
Jun 20, 2013
<div class="well">
    <p>me: Do you know who I love?
Simon: Who?
me: I can’t tell you, it’s a secret.
Simon: You can tell me, I’m a good secret-keeper.
me: Prove it, tell me one secret that you were supposed to keep that you’ve never told anyone.
Simon: This one time grandma gave me a cookie, and told me not to tell you.
me: Oh, really?
Simon: Yeah, really, see, I’m a good secret-keeper!</p>
