<h1>Simon Says</h1>
Jun 18, 2016
<div class="well">
    <p>Yesterday at the graduation party, grandma asked Simon to go get her a cupcake. She wanted a very specific cupcake, and I knew it wasn’t going to work out how she was hoping, but I decided to watch and see how it played out…
Grandma Tina: Simon, will you go get grandma a WHITE cupcake with WHITE frosting?
Simon: THERE’S CUPCAKES!?
Grandma: yes, can i have a WHITE cupcake with WHITE frosting?
Simon: can i have one too?
Grandma: yes. But bring me a WHITE cupcake with WHITE frosting.
So Simon goes off to find the cupcakes, clear on the other side of the party, and brings back the cupcake pictured.
Grandma: where is my cupcake?
Simon: it’s here.
Grandma: where is my frosting?
Simon: I dropped it and it all fell off.
Grandma (laughing uncontrollably): but I wanted a WHITE cupcake.
Simon: What?! You know I can’t be trusted!</p>
