<h1>Simon Says</h1>
Jun 18, 2016
<div class="well">
    <p><em>Yesterday at the graduation party, grandma asked Simon to go get her a cupcake.
She wanted a very specific cupcake, and I knew it wasn’t going to work out how she was hoping, but I decided to watch and see how it played out…</em></p>

<p><strong>Grandma Tina</strong>: Simon, will you go get grandma a WHITE cupcake with WHITE frosting?</p>

<p><strong>Simon</strong>: <strong>THERE’S CUPCAKES!?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Grandma</strong>: yes, can i have a WHITE cupcake with WHITE frosting?</p>

<p><strong>Simon</strong>: can i have one too?</p>

<p><strong>Grandma</strong>: yes. But bring me a WHITE cupcake with WHITE frosting.</p>

<p><em>So Simon goes off to find the cupcakes, clear on the other side of the party, and brings back the cupcake pictured.</em></p>

<p><strong>Grandma</strong>: where is my cupcake?</p>

<p><strong>Simon</strong>: it’s here.</p>

<p><strong>Grandma</strong>: where is my frosting?</p>

<p><strong>Simon</strong>: I dropped it and it all fell off.</p>

<p><strong>Grandma</strong> (laughing uncontrollably): but I wanted a WHITE cupcake.</p>

<p><strong>Simon</strong>: What?! You know I can’t be trusted!</p>
