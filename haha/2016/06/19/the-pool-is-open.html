<h1>Simon Says</h1>
Jun 19, 2016
<div class="well">
    <p>Me: so tonight, we’re going to Kelsey’s graduation party at grandma and grandpa’s…
Simon: no
Me: and go swimming in their pool, and eat tacos, and cake…
Simon: wait! How do you know the pool is going to be open.
Me: because they told me it is.
Simon: well, obviously they are lying to get me to come.</p>
